## 💡 About Me

Aspiring **Junior Penetration Tester** with a strong passion for cybersecurity and hands-on experience in **network security, system enumeration, and vulnerability analysis**. I’m actively working toward the **CompTIA Security+** certification and continually building my offensive security skillset through labs and platforms like **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box**.

I’m comfortable working with various tools and techniques for **reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation**, and I enjoy exploring security from both attacker and defender perspectives. I also build web apps in my spare time to keep my coding sharp and deepen my understanding of web vulnerabilities.

## 🚀 What I’m Looking For

I’m actively working toward becoming a **Cybersecurity Engineer**, with a strong focus on **penetration testing** and offensive security. My goal is to deepen my understanding of system vulnerabilities, network security, and exploit development, while building real-world experience through labs and hands-on practice.

With a background in **programming and web development**, I bring a strong technical foundation that enhances my approach to cybersecurity — from writing scripts for automation and recon to understanding how applications can be exploited.

I’m currently sharpening my skills on platforms like **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box**, where I regularly complete challenges related to enumeration, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation techniques. I’m constantly learning, documenting my progress, and building a mindset focused on curiosity, precision, and ethical responsibility.

I’m looking for opportunities where I can:
- Contribute to real-world security projects  
- Grow into a skilled penetration tester and security professional  
- Collaborate with teams focused on securing modern infrastructure  

Let’s connect if you're looking for a driven and motivated junior with a strong technical base and a passion for ethical hacking!
